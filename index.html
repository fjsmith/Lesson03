          <h2>Graphic Design Student</h2>

          <p>Though I am a musician at heart, I am currently headed in a graphic design direction. I have been studying in the latter field at Wake Tech for two years now.</p>
        <p>I work in Adobe programs such as InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. In addition to these, I do photography and I also draw. I am currently learning Web development and Web design as well.</p>

          <section class="project-item">
            <img src="images/Duck - Broken Timing Belt B&A.JPG" alt="Side-by-side of before/after versions of a photo of a boy holding a broken belt in front of a truck.">
            <h3>Cropped Portraits</h3>
            <p>The above image was part of one of my most recent assignments, completed for Illustrative Imaging class. This required me to conduct a photoshoot of a subject, crop the best six for a deeper effect, and present the before and after shots together.</p>

          <h3>Colorful Pots</h3>
          <p>The above image was part of an assignment for my Photographic Imaging class last fall. The idea was to capture photos emphasizing certain design elements, and I took this one to illustrate the element of color.</p>
